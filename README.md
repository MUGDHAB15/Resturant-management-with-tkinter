# Resturant-management-with-tkinter
Restaurant management system, with register, login, menu, generating bill and saving the bill to the database (SQL SERVER) with GUI in tkinter


This is my first GUI project with Tkinter. I have made a restaurant Management project for MB Foods. It has following pages:
1. Login
2. Register
3. Menu
4. About

If you are a new user, one will register onself, so it saves the data in the database. With your set user_ID and password you can login and then go to Menu tab and select what
ever you want to order
Once ordered bill can be generated you can save the bill so that it gets saved to the database.

The restaurant_final.py is the main python file with the code

I have also created seperate login file, register file and menu file for my ease seperately as the code was long and I don't missout on any thing

I hope this looks good and any suggestion or improvement is welcome. :)
